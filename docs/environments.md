# Environments

The package provides Gymnasium-compatible environments around generated MuJoCo
truss models.

## Model Sources

Environment constructors accept any of these model sources:

- `mujoco.MjSpec`
- `mujoco.MjModel`
- XML string
- path to an XML file
- `TrussEnvConfig`

## Environment Classes

- `MujocoTrussEnv`: base environment with tendon lengths, tendon velocities,
  center-of-mass position, and center-of-mass velocity in the observation.
- `MujocoRelativeObsEnv`: relative node-position observations and normalized
  actuator delta actions.
- `MujocoVelocityCommandEnv`: relative observations with direct velocity command
  actions.

## Shared Configuration

Shared configuration is provided by `TrussEnvConfig`:

```python
from mujoco_truss_gen import TrussEnvConfig

config = TrussEnvConfig(
    model_source=spec,
    max_steps=10_000,
    nsubsteps=1,
    speed=0.01,
    forward_weight=5.0,
    energy_weight=0.005,
    alive_bonus=0.1,
    rigidity_weight=0.5,
    slip_weight=0.1,
    critical_eig_threshold=0.03,
    slip_height=0.2,
    control_noise_std=0.0,
    control_noise_relative=True,
    runtime_apply_control_noise=False,
)
```

## Step and Reset Behavior

- `reset(seed=...)` follows the Gymnasium API and returns `(obs, info)`.
- `step(action)` returns `(obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info)`.
- `truncated` becomes true when `max_steps` is reached.
- `terminated` becomes true when the normalized rigidity metric falls below
  `critical_eig_threshold`.
- `info` includes reward components and `critical_eig`.

## Actions

- `MujocoTrussEnv` sends clipped actuator controls directly in the MuJoCo
  actuator control range.
- `MujocoRelativeObsEnv` expects actions in `[-1, 1]`; each action component
  changes the previous control by `action * config.speed`.
- `MujocoVelocityCommandEnv` expects actions in `[-config.speed, config.speed]`
  and sends those values directly.

## Rewards

The default reward combines forward velocity, alive bonus, energy penalty,
rigidity reward, and slip penalty. These defaults are provided for
experimentation, not as a canonical objective for every isoperimetric robot
task.

Custom tasks should subclass an environment and override `_get_obs()`,
`_compute_reward()`, `reset()`, or `step()` as needed.

## Rendering

- `render_mode="rgb_array"` returns a rendered NumPy RGB image.
- `render_mode="human"` opens a passive MuJoCo viewer when the local MuJoCo
  viewer module is available.
